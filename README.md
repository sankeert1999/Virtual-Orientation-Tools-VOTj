# Virtual Orienation Tool FIJI
This tool is designed to align objects of interest both horizontally and vertically from their base orientation. It requires an input image and a corresponding mask that defines the object of interest within the image.
This tool is adapted at aligning a single object in each image, and this alignment can seamlessly propagate across multiple channels in the case of multichannel images. 
It offers compatibility across a wide range of image types, including 2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D data.
